On https://www.bomengids.nl I use only static html files
However. I want to be able to change central data-parts for all 3000 pages in one go.

For instance I want to be able to adjust the navbar on one central place.

So I use includes in the static html pages. 
I have long used a javascript snippit I once found somewhere that worked and loaded includes, but I had no idea how. 
However, recently I needed to run some code after the include had finisched. To do so I had the re-make the javascript bit.

So the script here does just that: inject some data in a div on a staticv html site. And that data is downloaded from some url.

So have fun with it. If  you want to improve it: please do! 

# javascript-inject-static
